## 💡 Prototype

This project is currently a **front-end prototype**. It demonstrates the intended user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of the final application. All navigation and visual elements are in place, but the data displayed is static and the forms/buttons do not connect to a live backend database.

## 🚀 Full-stack App Coming

The next phase of development will involve transforming this prototype into a **full-stack application**. This will include:
*   **Backend Development:** Implementing a robust server-side architecture (e.g., using Node.js, Python/Django/Flask, or similar) to handle user authentication, data storage, and business logic.
*   **Database Integration:** Connecting the application to a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user profiles, workout logs, schedules, and goals.
*   **Dynamic Functionality:** Making all features fully functional, allowing users to interact with and save their personal data.
